<br>**A blurb about me:** <br><br>
I am studying data journalism at Boston University, graduating in May of 2026.

I enjoy journalism that turns complex data into concise, impactful, and literary stories. I’m interested in open-source investigative reporting, long-form storytelling, and cool turns of phrases.

Right now, I am working on a project tracking harmful algae blooms through satellite imagery.

I have collaborated on a nationwide investigation into judicial ethics for ProPublica and reported on Massachusetts farmworkers’ working conditions for the Boston Globe in the past — you can check out those stories + some of the other stuff I’ve done in the tabs above.

In my spare time, I noodle around on my guitar and bass. I write songs. I cook pasta. I bike to and fro, always with a helmet on. I am currently, very slowly, reading The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus.

I think that covers it!
