<br>**A blurb about me:** <br><br>
I am a graduate student at Boston University, graduating in May of 2026. I study data journalism there. I like reporting with interesting data components, and I hope to create literary stories out of open-source investigations in the future. My goal is that these works may illuminate abuses of power.

Recently, I collaborated on a nationwide investigation into judicial ethics for ProPublica and reported on Massachusetts farmworkers' working conditions for the Boston Globe. You can check out those stories + some of the other stuff I've done in the "journalism" tab above. 

In my spare time, I noodle around on my guitar and bass. I write songs. I cook pasta. I bike to and fro, always with a helmet on. I am currently, very slowly, reading The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus.

I think that covers it!
